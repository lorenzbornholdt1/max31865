# Simple Example of the Max31865 for Zephyr OS
# About
Simple example and rudimentary library to read the temperature from the MAX31865, a resistor-to-digital converter, using the SPI-API of Zephyr OS.

The example is for the ST Nucleo-l476rg developer board. The used pinout corresponds to the pinout of Zephyr in version 2.499:
## TODOs
Fix SPI on Nucleo or try another board.
